//! Making a `fork()` visible to handles created before it.
//!
//! `fork` copies the address space but not the threads, so a child inherits
//! every [`AimDbHandle`](crate::AimDbHandle), [`SyncProducer`](crate::SyncProducer)
//! and [`SyncConsumer`](crate::SyncConsumer) the parent held — and none of the
//! runtime thread that makes them work. Without the check below, the child's
//! `set()` pushes into a buffer nobody drains and returns `Ok`.
//!
//! # Why a generation counter and not a flag
//!
//! A `bool` would poison the child permanently, including for a database the
//! *child itself* attaches afterwards. A counter makes staleness relative: a
//! handle is unusable when the process has forked since it was made, and one
//! made after the fork is fine.
//!
//! # Why `pthread_atfork` and not `getpid`
//!
//! Because this sits on the publish path. The `pthread_atfork` handler updates
//! a generation counter, letting each publish check one relaxed atomic load
//! instead of querying the operating system for the process identity.
//!
//! # The process-global caveat
//!
//! Registering a `pthread_atfork` handler is a process-wide decision, and a
//! library making one on an application's behalf is normally a trespass. This
//! is the exception: only the crate that owns the runtime thread knows the
//! thread is gone, so nobody above can make this check — and the handler is
//! registered lazily, on the first [`generation`] (which every `attach` takes),
//! so a program that never uses the sync facade never gets one.
